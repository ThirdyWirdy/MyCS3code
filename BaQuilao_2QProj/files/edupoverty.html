        <h1 id="Title">Solving Education Poverty</h1> <!--Solving Education Poverty-->
        <p>At Educacy, we believe education is the foundation for breaking the cycle of poverty. Our initiatives
            focus on providing
            underserved communities with access to quality learning resources, scholarships, and teacher training
            programs. But the ones doing an effort to combat this problem are not just us. Other organizations,
            governments, and foundations have helped with this issue and have given proper education to those who
            truly
            need it. Now, below is a showcase of the initiatives and projects we and other organizations have done
            or are currently doing:</p>
        <section id="initatives"> <!--List of Initatives-->
            <article>
                <ul id="initiativesList">
                    <li>In the Gambia, ChildFund and Ding Ding Yiriwa Federation supported teachers and caregivers at
                        two
                        schools where EPW is implemented – Jambanjelly Lower Basic School and Quranic Illumination
                        Center –
                        to find a solution to help children catch up to grade-level literacy standards. The school
                        community
                        agreed to implement remedial classes during the school break that would support 705 children in
                        grades 2-5 improve their literacy, numeracy and social-emotional skills.</li>
                    <li>The Sahel Education Summit founded the Women’s Empowerment and Demographic Dividend. This
                        initiative, founded by Burkina Faso, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, allowed
                        young
                        girls and women who were exposed to factors such as extreme poverty, forced migration, and high
                        fertility rates the opportunity to stay in school. </li>
                    <li>Countries such as Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania have implemented the Free Education Policy. This
                        policy directly addresses inaccessibility by making school fees low and more affordable for all.
                    </li>
                    <li>NEPC members, NGOs, and research institutes from Western Balkans and Turkey (IPA countries)
                        created the The ARISE – Action for Reducing Inequalities in Education – project. This
                        project will support schools, grassroots organisations and policy makers in developing actions
                        and
                        policies
                        aimed at mitigating the effect of low socio-economic status on students’ achievement, reducing
                        inequalities in education.</li>
                    <li>For Educacy, we have implemented multiple charity programs and helped construct over 100
                        learning
                        centers in impoverished areas around the world. We have also founded many initatives, like the
                        Education for All (EFA) initative which has provided free education to over 50,000 children in
                        need.
