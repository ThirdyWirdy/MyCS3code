	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>A chemical engineer would wake up early in the morning, then eat, shower, and get ready. They would also check emails for updates/communication, and check for any meetings or tasks to do for the day before going to the workplace. A chemical engineer typically works at a chemical plant or a laboratory. Their working environments are hazardous and makes them more prone or vulnerable to accidents.  Workwear worn by a chemical engineer depends on the occasion, but they usually wear a full body suit and protective gear like hard hats, safety glasses, and boots. </p>

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>The main role of chemical engineers is to design and troubleshoot processes for the production of chemicals, fuels, foods, pharmaceuticals, and more, in order to improve them and increase efficiency. To achieve this, chemical engineers conduct experiments and analyze data during their time at work. Chemical engineers also spend time at offices, attending meetings and presenting reports/proposals. They deal with a large amount of paperwork, and take on multiple projects every year to meet requirements. Using the foundations of math, physics, and chemistry, chemical engineers help improve our factories and industries.</p>

	      <p>Here, you will see that the video “Everything You’ll Learn in Chemical Engineering” offers a good overview of the core subjects and skills taught in a chemical engineering program. It walks viewers through topics like thermodynamics, reaction engineering, process control, and transport phenomena, which are all integral components of the discipline. This video aims to give both curious students and upcoming college freshmen a clear roadmap of what to expect for chemical engineering.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>Excerpts from "Pharmaceuticals – My Experience as a Chemical Engineer"</p>
	      <p>So why did I become a Chemical Engineer? For this I thank my old chemistry teacher, Mr Watts, who said ‘Why don’t you become a Chemical Engineer?’ So off I went to see what a Chemical Engineer did! That one conversation gave me a rewarding career over 40 years.</p>
		  <p>Working within the pharmaceutical industry gave me the opportunity not only to use chemical engineering unit processes but also provided the opportunity to be involved in layouts, people and material flows and regulatory requirements.</p>
		  <p>On the day I retired I was asked if I would do the same again. The answer I gave was a resounding yes. Through Chemical Engineering I have had various roles from plant based chemical engineer, to lead process engineer and finally as a project manager, I have travelled the world and had over 40 years of a worthwhile career.</p>
