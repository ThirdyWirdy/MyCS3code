        <p>You know you love me (Yo), I know you care (Uh-huh)<br>
            Just shout whenever (Yo), and I'll be there (Uh-huh)<br>
            You are my love (Yo), you are my heart (Uh-huh)<br>
            And we will never, ever, ever be apart (Yo, uh-huh)<br>
            Are we an item? (Yo) Girl, quit playin' (Uh-huh)<br>
            "We're just friends" (Yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)<br>
            Said, "There's another" (Yo), and looked right in my eyes (Uh-huh)<br>

        <p>When I was thirteen, I had my first love<br>
            There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above<br>
            She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck<br>
            She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (Woo)<br>
            She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and<br>
            At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend<br>
            She knows she got me dazin', 'cause she was so amazin'<br>
            And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'<br>
        </p>
