            <div class="aboutOrg">
                <p>Edu-cacy is an advocacy group founded in August 2025 with the mission of increasing the quality of
                    education and eliminating education poverty. Established by a group of students from the Philippine
                    Science High School â€“ Southern Mindanao Campus (PSHS-SMC) during their third year of high school,
                    the organization was born out of a shared realization that education, while a fundamental right,
                    remains inaccessible or of poor quality for many. Led by its main founder, Victor A. Quilao III,
                    Edu-cacy envisions a future where every learner, regardless of background, has access to the tools,
                    resources, and opportunities needed to thrive academically and beyond.</p>
                <p>The idea for Edu-cacy began when its founders, while conducting research for a school assignment,
                    uncovered alarming gaps and inequalities in the education system. What started as an academic task
                    quickly transformed into a call to action, as they recognized the urgency of addressing these issues
                    beyond the classroom. Motivated by their findings, they organized themselves into a formal group
                    dedicated to advocacy, outreach, and solution-driven initiatives. Today, Edu-cacy stands as a
                    youth-led movement committed to bridging educational divides, empowering communities, and inspiring
                    others to join the fight for a more equitable and high-quality education system.</p>
